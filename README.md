# Employee-Tracker

## Description
I created this application to gain experience on Postgres and SQL databases. During this project I gained experience in SQL queries such as displaying, inserting and updating data. I had more inquirer practice and became more familiar with the way I can use it to interact with my database and create a ui within the command line.


## Installation
You can clone my repo by using the green code button at the top of this page. 
Alternatively, you can watch my walkthrough for a short video on the functionality of my app here: https://youtu.be/5A6rpt3KXXM

## Usage
Once you have the command line open use npm i to install the neccesary node modules and create your .env file. From there type the command "npm run start" and you will be greeted with the main menu as shown below

Once you decide which option you would like to choose, simply select that option and enter any neccesary information when prompted
